## <p align="center"> Introduction

Welcome to The Dog Shop - a dedicated store for site users to purchase dog related products. The site also has a dedicated blog section where our dog experts post relevant articles related to dog’s health and wellbeing. Site users can interact with blog posts by adding comments on posts and interacting with other site users. The store is of course fictional and for educational purposes only. 

I built this e-commerce site for my 4th and final milestone project he Code Institutes Full Stack Software Development Course. The overall goal of the project was to design, build and launch a full stack django based software app, that allows users to create an account, be authenticated, store and manipulate data, and purchase products using the stripe payment platform. Due to the nature of the site, additional authentication and validation protocols have been used to prevent unintended use of the site.
